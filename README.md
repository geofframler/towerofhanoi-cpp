# The Tower of Hanoi
#### programmed by Geoff Ramler in C++

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle with three rods and ‘n’ number of discs.

The objective of this puzzle is to transfer the entire stack of discs to another rod.

The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. 

### Rules:
Only a single disc is allowed to be transferred at a time.

Each move should consist of taking the upper disc from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.

Only the top most disc on the stack can be moved.

Larger discs cannot be placed on top of smaller discs.
